# Atlanta Deep Learning Meetup
This is the code repository associated with the Atlanta Deep Learning Meetup
presentation on April 10, 2017 by John Stone and Frank Hinek.

## Overview
* **Autopilot** - A modified implementation of the "End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars" paper by NVIDIA using TensorFlow.  A convolutional neural network is trained to map raw pixels from a camera to steering commands.

## Usage

To clone this repository and include the `Autopilot` code example module use the following command:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/frankhinek/Meetup-ADL-17-Apr-10.git
```

The example contains a README that explains how to get your environment setup
to run the code.
